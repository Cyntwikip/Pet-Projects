Given how big the field is and how we're moving ever-closer to applying machine learning in many different fields, I think the foundations given by the course will definitely be useful and will be a huge skill set in my professional career. Another thing I found very valuable as well was that the course was able to give importance to machine learning and explain different machine learning concepts that seem very daunting and complicated at first. And although this was only an introductory course, the topics and lessons I learned over the term was definitely plenty and has further piqued my interest in the topic.","If I were to name a few things that can be improve in the course, it'll probably be the complexity of some of the lessons. Maybe it was because I had no formal background in linear algebra, but there were some lessons where I would get a bit lost into the explanations of some of the formulas different machine learning techniques would use. In the future, maybe it might be better to start of with an a top-down or a layman's explanation of those formulas or techniques to give a better grasp on what's supposed to be happening before giving a more in-depth explanation.","Hi, Sir!! Thank you very much for being our prof for the past term and for teaching us a lot of new concepts and techniques within machine learning. It's sad to know that the term is quickly ending but I just want to say that I'm very grateful for the past few months and for the considerations you've given to me and the rest of the class. I really appreciate that you're constantly asking for feedback, since as a student, it's hard when it feels like a prof isn't listening in to your struggles. I do hope that we meet again soon and I also hope we weren't much of a headache for you, Sir. Thank you again and wishing you the best in the rest of your teaching career. :>>"

Preface to lessons using kaggle or a mini quiz to gauge how much the students actually know or don't know so that the lessons can be better tailored to their needs

Rather than asking us to code using functions, when we don't know how to implement yet, i think that learning how to manually apply it is good :D like what we did for knn, cause it's clearer how to follow","Hello sir! I wanna start by saying thank you for this term and sorry the class was kinda dead and we had a hard time understanding things <:D I think that we learned a lot and the people who needed this class for thesis got what they came for cause we did, and I'm grateful for that, however, it was difficult to follow a lot of the lessons. I really think that if there was more class engagement, the lessons would be easier to get? Cause like you know, how other students understand the lessons is probably also how I'll understand it.
